## üß© Modules Overview

This section provides a detailed overview of the main modules that power **NewsDigest: AI-Powered News Aggregator and Summarizer**.

## 1. Feed Aggregator

**Purpose:**  
To periodically fetch and process news articles from multiple RSS feeds, deduplicate them, and prepare structured entries for storage and personalization.

**Inputs:**
- `feeds.yaml`: A configuration file containing RSS feed URLs and associated metadata (e.g., source name and topic).
- Aggregation interval (default: every 10 minutes).

**Processing / Logic:**
1. **Load Feed Sources:**  
   Reads `feeds.yaml` to retrieve RSS URLs and metadata (source, topic).

2. **Asynchronous Fetching:**  
   Uses **aiohttp** for concurrent HTTP requests to efficiently fetch raw RSS XML data.

3. **Parse Feed Items:**  
   Uses **feedparser** to extract and standardize items into fields: `title`, `link`, `published`, `image`, `source`, `topic`.

4. **Send to Deduplication Module:**  
   - Generate SBERT embeddings for titles.
   - Filter out semantically similar (duplicate) articles.

5. **Database Insertion Logic:**  
   - Insert if the article‚Äôs link does not exist.
   - Update if the link exists but with a newer published timestamp.
   - Ignore otherwise.

6. **Scheduled Execution:**  
   Runs on a separate thread and repeats at defined intervals.

**Outputs:**
- Structured articles ready for storage.
- Database entries: newly inserted or selectively updated articles.

---

## 2. Deduplication Algorithm

**Purpose:**  
To remove semantically similar articles based on the contextual similarity of their titles, ensuring a diverse news feed.

**Inputs:**
- A list of article dictionaries (each with a `title` field).
- A Sentence-BERT (SBERT) model instance.
- The target device for inference (`cpu` or `cuda`).

**Processing / Logic:**
- Extracts all titles from the input articles.
- Generates contextual embeddings for these titles using the SBERT model.
- Appends the generated embedding to each corresponding article dictionary.
- Computes pairwise cosine similarity between the embeddings to measure semantic closeness. The cosine similarity between two embeddings **A** and **B** is given by:

  $$ \mathrm{Cosine\ Similarity}\left(\vec{A},\vec{B}\right)=\frac{\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B}}{|\vec{A}|\cdot|\vec{B}|} $$

- If the similarity score exceeds a threshold of **0.9**, one article is marked as a duplicate.
- Filters out the duplicate articles, retaining only distinct ones.

**Output:**
- A list of unique articles with contextual embeddings attached.

---

## 3. Summarizer

**Purpose:**  
The Summarizer module is responsible for generating concise AI summaries of full news articles using a transformer-based model.

**Inputs:**
- `article_id`: Unique identifier of the article to summarize.

**Processing / Logic:**
1. The system receives a request with an `article_id`.
2. It checks if the summary already exists in the database:
   - If found, the summary is retrieved directly and returned.
   - If not, it fetches the full article URL, extracts content using **Newspaper3K**, and generates a summary with **DistilBART** (60-100 words).
3. The system logs this interaction by updating the user‚Äôs read history.
4. The final summary is returned to the user interface.

**Outputs:**
- AI-generated summary (60-100 words) of the article content.

---

## 4. Recommendation System

**Purpose:**  
Generates personalized article recommendations based on user reading history, combining contextual embeddings with recency-based weighting to rank articles by relevance and freshness.

**Inputs:**
- `user`: Authenticated user object
- Optional:
  - `recency_factor`: Balance between recency and similarity.
  - `decay_strength`: Weight steepness for recent reads.

**Processing / Logic:**
1. **History Check:**
   - Verifies if the user has reading history.
   - Returns an empty list if no records are found.
   
2. **Time-Weighted Embedding Generation:**
   - Retrieves up to **N** (default: 10) recent articles viewed by the user.
   - For each article, fetches:
     - Title embeddings from the DB.
     - Viewing timestamp.
   - Calculates time-normalized recency for each article, applying exponential weighting:

   $$ w_i=\frac{e^{r_i\cdot\beta}}{\sum_{j=1}^{N}e^{r_j\cdot\beta}} $$

   where **r_i** is the normalized recency, and **Œ≤** is the decay strength.

   - Final user embedding:

   $$ \vec{u}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}w_i\cdot\vec{e_i} $$

   where **e_i** is the embedding of article **i**.

3. **Scoring & Filtering:**
   - Filters out articles already viewed by the user.
   - Scores remaining articles using:

   $$ \mathrm{Score}=\left(1-\alpha\right)\cdot\mathrm{CosineDistance}\left(\vec{u},\vec{a}\right)+\alpha\cdot\mathrm{DaysSincePublished} $$

   where **Œ±** is the recency factor.

4. **Pagination:**  
   - Results are paginated and formatted before being returned.

**Outputs:**
- A list of article dictionaries.

---

## 5. Search Engine

**Purpose:**  
The Search Engine module enables users to efficiently find news articles either through direct keyword matches or via semantic similarity, enhancing discoverability and personalization.

**Inputs:**
- `query`: Search string.
- `context`: Boolean indicating keyword or contextual search.

**Processing / Logic:**
- If `context = False`:
  - Performs an OR-based keyword match in article titles/content.
  - Returns the latest matching articles.
  
- If `context = True`:
  - Generates an embedding for the query using SBERT.
  - Computes cosine similarity with stored article embeddings.
  - Returns top-ranked results by similarity.

- Results are paginated and formatted before being returned.

**Output:**
- Paginated list of article dictionaries relevant to the query.

---

## 6. Authentication System

**Purpose:**  
Ensures secure access to the platform by verifying user credentials and managing session tokens. Implements JWT-based authentication to provide stateless, scalable user validation.

**Inputs:**
- `username`: Username entered by the user.
- `password`: Password entered by the user.

**Processing / Logic:**
- Checks if the username exists in the system.
- If the user exists, compares the provided password with the stored hashed password using a secure verification method.
- If valid, generates:
  - A short-lived JWT access token.
  - A long-lived refresh token.

**Output:**
- JSON response containing `access_token`.
- HTTP-only cookie containing `refresh_token`.

---

## 7. User Operations Module

**Purpose:**  
Manages all user interactions with content, including liking, bookmarking, viewing history, and managing subscriptions.

**Inputs:**
- `user_id`: ID of the logged-in user.
- `article_id` (optional): For actions like like, bookmark, or history update.
- `source_id` (optional): For subscribing/unsubscribing to news sources.

**Processing / Logic:**
- **User Likes**: Allows users to like or unlike articles.
- **User Bookmarks**: Allows users to bookmark or unbookmark articles.
- **User History**: Updates when an article is read or summarized, recording timestamps.
- **User Subscriptions**: Allows subscribing or unsubscribing to sources.

**Outputs:**
- Success/failure response.
- User-specific data (liked articles, bookmarks, history, subscriptions).

---

## 8. User Management System

**Purpose:**  
Enables users to create and manage their accounts. Supports secure registration, profile updates, password changes, and account deletion.

**Inputs:**
- `User data` (full name, username, email, password)
- `Updated user information` (name, email, password)
- `Authentication token` (to authorize user actions)

**Processing / Logic:**
- **User Registration**: Accepts and validates user data, stores it securely in the database.
- **Profile Update**: Allows updating name/email after validation.
- **Password Update**: Verifies current password, updates with a hashed new password.
- **Account Deletion**: Permanently deletes the user‚Äôs data.

**Output:**
- Confirmation messages for each operation (e.g., "User registered", "Profile updated", "Password changed", "Account deleted").
